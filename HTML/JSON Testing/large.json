This component will include: civil works for widening and upgrading of approximately 400 km of existing single lane/intermediate lane national highways of Non-National Highway Development Project (NHDP) network in the project states, to two lane standards through item-rate contracts; providing supervision of quality control services, and others including costs towards land acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation, shifting of utilities. The second component of the project is institutional development component. The project will enhance the institutional capacity of MoRTH to better manage the non-NHDP network through supporting specific intervention in five areas, viz., process improvements, network monitoring and management, financing, governance and accountability, and training. The third component of the project is road safety component. This component will pursue the objective of improving road safety through: 1) updating Indian standards and regulations related to road safety; 2) improving road accident data collection and analysis at central and state levels through implementation of the Road Accident Database Management System (RADMS) in project states; 3) strengthening road safety capacity at the central level, and 4)

There are five components to the project. The first component of the project is policy support. This will support developing and implementing Renewable Energy (RE) legislation and policies to achieve cost reduction, efficiency improvement, and smooth grid integration. The second component of the project is grid integration/access and technical design. This component will consist of targeted studies to ensure improved grid integration for large-scale grid-connected RE and grid access for distributed RE; and strategic and optimal deployment of key RE technologies to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. The third component of the project is technology improvement. Under this component the technology improvements will include, but not limited to: a) increasing efficiency of existing wind farms; b) improving quality and reliability and reducing costs of off-shore wind turbine technologies; c) increasing efficiency of existing large-scale grid connected solar Photovoltaic (PV) farms; and d) possibly improving Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) domestic manufacturing capacity. The fourth component of the project is pilot demonstration.

The DPL has been prepared jointly with the European Union (EU) and the African Development Bank (AfDB), leveraging a further US$ 250 million in support of common key policy actions such as the budget, procurement and open governance reforms. The programmatic approach is warranted by the scope and depth of the government's governance reform program, the implementation of which will require time, assistance, and flexibility. This operation is complemented by the transition fund project supporting the implementation of Morocco's new governance framework. This US$ 4 million grant provides technical assistance for the implementation of structural reforms fostering public engagement; performance based budgeting and fiscal decentralization. The series adopts a holistic and integrated approach to enhance its impact. It is supporting governance reforms across the public sector covering the central government; State owned Enterprises, or SoEs and agencies, local governments as well as inter-governmental relations. The Bank has provided policy advice and technical assistance for the design of most policy measures and laws supported by this DPL, with the support from the MNA multi-donor trust fund. The transition fund governance project will support the implementation of these structural reforms. While building on the long-standing engagement with public administration reform, under the Public Administration Reform Loan (PARL) series, this program supports the concretization of the performance budgeting reform through the adoption and implementation of the new organic budget law and procurement decree.

This component will provide direct municipal grants to municipalities that are hosting the largest concentration of Syrians (i.e., weighting the number of Syrians hosted and their ratio to the host population). Reflecting the increased size of their populations, the Grants will allow municipalities to finance additional public services and programs to help improve living conditions, reduce communal tensions and enhance social cohesion for the benefit of the Jordanians and Syrians living in their jurisdictions. Finally, the second component is the institutional development and project management. This second component will finance two subcomponents: (i) subcomponent 2A - technical assistance to participating municipalities to plan, implement and manage activities funded by the Municipal Grant, as well as project management support to implementing agencies to coordinate, manage and oversee the project; and (ii) subcomponent 2B - capacity building of key Government agencies and vulnerable communities in emergency preparedness, and risk planning, management and financing.

The project has four components. The first component is support for sanitary and phytosanitary services. This component aims to strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of sanitary and phytosanitary services in order to reduce existing obstacles to agricultural and food trade. The component will be structured into following three sub-components: (i) food safety capacity building to establish a roadmap for comprehensive reforms, including key principles for the national food safety control policy and enforcement; (ii) upgrading plant health and phytosanitary system will support upgrading the State Phytosanitary Control Services (SPCS) which is mandated to ensure phytosanitary safety on the import, production, storage, and processing of plant and plant products; and (iii) animal health and veterinary services will support the strengthening the State Veterinary Services (SVS) and promotion of a complementary private veterinary sectors as key elements being considered to provide a suitable environment for improving and securing animal production. The second component is agribusiness value chain development. This component will help develop value chains by partially financing demand-driven investment proposals. It will also support activities for improving seed varieties and quality of seeds entering the market. It has following two sub-components: (i) investment and advisory support for agribusiness value chain development to: (a) provide development support for value chain participants to assist them to establish productive partnerships and prepare sub-project proposals for funding under the project, and (b) investment support for agribusiness value chains; and (ii) seed sector development will help to build on the experience of Second Agricultural Development and Credit Project (ADCP-II) and will support the seed development chain that includes the National Research Institute for Crop Husbandry (NRICH) and its research stations. The third component is financial services to agribusiness.

Five areas of priority, or policy areas, have been identified. First, better fiscal and financial management will enable policymakers to maximize benefits accruing from increased revenues from natural resources. Second, the revenue management framework in the hydropower and mining sectors should also be clearly defined to maximize revenues accruing over time to the government for development purposes while attracting good quality investment in the sector. Third, diversification of economic growth sources through a competitive private sector outside the resource sector is critical to ensure the sustainability of growth. As the natural resource sector is capital intensive, it does not provide abundant job opportunities, as opposed to manufacturing, agribusiness or services. Diversified sources of growth are also important to reduce vulnerability to developments and exogenous shocks in narrow set of sectors. Finally, the fourth and fifth priorities for translating increased revenues from the natural sectors into improved public service delivery are a strong public sector capable of managing these revenues effectively coupled with the establishment of sustainable financing mechanisms for schools and health facilities. PRSO 9 supports the establishment of a mining revenue committee and its reporting on fiscal regime policy issues and options in the sector. In education, PRSO 9 supports making available for dissemination school based expenditure reports, to monitor spending in general and the school block grant scheme in particular." }, "project_name" : "Lao PDR Ninth Poverty Reduction Support Operation", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.", "DocType" : "FIA", "EntityID" : "090224b081fa5f95_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081fa5f95_1_0", "DocDate" : "10-OCT-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000290557_20130809110209", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000290557_20130809110209", "DocDate" : "10-JUL-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGID", "EntityID" : "000001843_20130711151329", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20130711151329", "DocDate" : "12-DEC-2012" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Closed", "regionname" : "East Asia and Pacific", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Central government administration" }, { "Name" : "General industry and trade sector" }, { "Name" : "General education sector" }, { "Name" : "Non-compulsory health finance" }, { "Name" : "Thermal Power Generation" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Central government administration", "Percent" : 40 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "General industry and trade sector", "Percent" : 20 }, "sector3" : { "Name" : "General education sector", "Percent" : 15 }, "sector4" : { "Name" : "Non-compulsory health finance", "Percent" : 15 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Central government administration", "code" : "BC" }, { "name" : "General industry and trade sector", "code" : "YZ" }, { "name" : "General education sector", "code" : "EZ" }, { "name" : "Non-compulsory health finance", "code" : "FB" }, { "name" : "Thermal Power Generation", "code" : "LG" } ], "sectorcode" : "LG,FB,EZ,YZ,BC", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Closed", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Regulation and competition policy", "Percent" : 14 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Regulation and competition policy", "code" : "40" }, { "name" : "Trade facilitation and market access", "code" : "49" }, { "name" : "Public expenditure, financial management and procurement", "code" : "27" }, { "name" : "Health system performance", "code" : "67" } ], "themecode" : "67,27,49,40", "totalamt" : 20000000, "totalcommamt" : 20000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P143025/lao-pdr-ninth-poverty-reduction-support-operation?lang=en" }

The project will support the establishment and operation of Nigeria Mortgage Refinance Company (NMRC), created in partnership between private financial institutions, development finance institutions, and the ministry of finance. It will issue standard corporate bonds into the capital markets and subsequently issue loans (refinance and pre-finance) to mortgage lending institutions. The second component is establishment of a mortgage guarantee product, targeted at lower income borrowers. The project will fund the product development including testing and financial modeling, and then launch a competitive process, among private or public owned nonbank financial institutions to select a mortgage guarantee agent to implement the project. The project will also provide a line of credit to the project implementing entity on account of the mortgage guarantee agent for the issuance of mortgage guarantee products to eligible lenders. The third component is Housing Microfinance (HMF). This component aims to support the development and piloting of new and or emerging formal HMF products and to demonstrate a sustainable business case for these activities. The fourth component is Technical Assistance (TA) and capacity building. The TA will be provided to support components one, two, and three. The TA will include provision of operational support to NMRC including assistance for bond issuance, mortgage lender training, mortgage consumer protections and financial literacy, housing market information, and impact evaluation of the mortgage market. TA also will be provided for HMF product development and piloting, Microfinance Banks (MFBs) staff training, consumer protection, impact evaluation, and related ancillary support services necessary for establishing sustainable HMF operations." }, "project_name" : "Housing Finance Development Program", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PAD", "EntityID" : "000442464_20130911092410", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130911092410", "DocDate" : "30-AUG-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "090224b081aff444_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081aff444_1_0", "DocDate" : "24-APR-2013" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Active", "regionname" : "Africa", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Housing finance" }, { "Name" : "Housing construction" }, { "Name" : "Capital markets" }, { "Name" : "Vocational training" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Housing finance", "Percent" : 85 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "Housing construction", "Percent" : 5 }, "sector3" : { "Name" : "Capital markets", "Percent" : 5 }, "sector4" : { "Name" : "Vocational training", "Percent" : 5 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Housing finance", "code" : "FC" }, { "name" : "Housing construction", "code" : "YC" }, { "name" : "Capital markets", "code" : "FK" }, { "name" : "Vocational training", "code" : "EV" } ], "sectorcode" : "EV,FK,YC,FC", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Active", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Land administration and management", "Percent" : 5 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Land administration and management", "code" : "83" }, { "name" : "Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support", "code" : "41" } ], "themecode" : "41,83", "totalamt" : 300000000, "totalcommamt" : 300000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P131973/housing-finance-development-program?lang=en" }

First, the project will improve the business climate by simplifying the processes of registering a business and obtaining a license, updating outdated legal framework governing business entry, and introducing electronic payment facilities for business and tax services. Second, fiscal transparency will be enhanced by removing legislative impediments to business and investment. Third, public financial management will improve through the creation of an independent commission for supervising public enterprises. Fourth, targeting social assistance will improve economic reform through the merging of the Social Welfare Agency and the Social Security Fund.

The Adaptation Fund (AF) was established to finance concrete adaptation projects and programs in developing countries that are parties to the Kyoto protocol and are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. On December, 2012 the proposal submitted by the International Bank for reconstruction and Development (IBRD) to the AF Board seeking access to resources in support of the 'Increasing Climate Resilience and Enhancing Sustainable Land Management in the Southwest of Buenos Aires Province' project in Argentina, was approved.

This component aims to promote further regional market integration, sector liberalization, and legal and regulatory reforms, and will include subcomponents focused on Technical Assistance (TA), capacity building, and training including the TA to assist the government with preparatory work for the submarine cable FLY-LION3 (From Comoros to Mayotte and Madagascar), including environmental studies feasibility studies and demand analysis. The second component is connectivity. This component will finance (i) membership and participation in the FLY-LION3 cable -- the link between Comoros, Mayotte and Madagascar-- under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement, which will ensure connectivity with LION-2; (ii) advance purchase of additional broadband capacity from East African Submarine System (EASSy), FLY-LION3 and/or LION2 and its use to provide demand stimulation measures by providing affordable bandwidth to key users such as the university, schools, hospitals, etc.; and (iii) additional measures to stimulate demand including by promoting the creation of local ISPs and establishing a carrier-independent Internet Exchange Point (IXP). And the third component is project management. This component will consist of support to finance project management costs including project coordination, procurement, financial management, monitoring & evaluation, communication, environmental and social safeguards, office equipment, incremental operating costs, and audits." }, "project_name" : "RCIP4 - Regional Communications Infrastructure Program - APL 4", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.", "DocType" : "FIA", "EntityID" : "090224b0820369b7_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0820369b7_1_0", "DocDate" : "24-SEP-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Disbursement Letter (Disbursement Letter),  Vol.", "DocType" : "Disbursement Letter", "EntityID" : "090224b082035b03_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082035b03_1_0", "DocDate" : "24-SEP-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PAD", "EntityID" : "000445729_20130822123515", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000445729_20130822123515", "DocDate" : "14-AUG-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PAD", "EntityID" : "000333037_20131017110210", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20131017110210", "DocDate" : "14-AUG-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Agreement (AGR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "AGR", "EntityID" : "090224b081b9a38e_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081b9a38e_1_0", "DocDate" : "25-FEB-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISDS", "EntityID" : "090224b081919e9f_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081919e9f_1_0", "DocDate" : "07-FEB-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "090224b0818fd0e6_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0818fd0e6_1_0", "DocDate" : "05-FEB-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000231615_20121213120444", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000231615_20121213120444", "DocDate" : "01-NOV-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "RPL", "EntityID" : "000231615_20121213140130", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000231615_20121213140130", "DocDate" : "01-NOV-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (INTEGRATED SAFEGUARDS DATA SHEET),  Vol.", "DocType" : "INTEGRATED SAFEGUARDS DATA SHEET", "EntityID" : "0000A8056_2012030116305860", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012030116305860", "DocDate" : "01-MAR-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "0000A8056_2012022717595783", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012022717595783", "DocDate" : "27-FEB-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Agreement (AGR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "AGR", "EntityID" : "000014464_2012050116574523", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2012050116574523", "DocDate" : "16-FEB-2012" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Active", "regionname" : "Africa", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Telecommunications" }, { "Name" : "Information technology" }, { "Name" : "Public administration- Information and communications" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Telecommunications", "Percent" : 60 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "Information technology", "Percent" : 30 }, "sector3" : { "Name" : "Public administration- Information and communications", "Percent" : 10 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Telecommunications", "code" : "CT" }, { "name" : "Information technology", "code" : "CA" }, { "name" : "Public administration- Information and communications", "code" : "BM" } ], "sectorcode" : "BM,CA,CT", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Active", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Administrative and civil service reform", "Percent" : 20 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Administrative and civil service reform", "code" : "25" }, { "name" : "Rural services and infrastructure", "code" : "78" }, { "name" : "Regulation and competition policy", "code" : "40" }, { "name" : "Infrastructure services for private sector development", "code" : "39" } ], "themecode" : "39,40,78,25", "totalamt" : 22000000, "totalcommamt" : 22000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P118213/rcip4-regional-communications-infrastructure-program-apl-4?lang=en" }

Service improvements will depend on training both the providers and users of services to be able to tailor information more effectively to users needs. The geographical focus will be countrywide. The project will have social and economic benefits by managing risk in weather-related disasters that disproportionately affect the poor and vulnerable populations through improving forecasting, early warning systems and the observed climatology of Yemen. The project consists of the following four components: 1) the first component aims to improve climate resilience in Yemen through institutional strengthening and capacity building by provisioning of weather, climate and water services that meet stakeholders needs by creating the conditions that ensure institutional, staffing and financial sustainability of the key providers; 2) the second component aims to upgrade and expand the observations networks for meteorology, agro-meteorology and hydrometeorology, ensuring that these networks are interoperable; 3) the third component provides for the implementation of a systematic upgrade of the weather, climate and water-related end-to-end services provided to all agencies, communities and individuals; 4) and the fourth component involves program management and knowledge sharing.

The series has been prepared in line with good practice principles for development policy operations in situations of fragility. The series focuses on areas of heightened importance in these settings: (1) strengthening public confidence in government by improving the transparency of budgets and accountability of public officials; (2) building investor confidence through rapid, visible improvements in the business climate; and (3) quickly creating economic opportunities by focusing on potential sources of growth and employment, particularly on labor-intensive exports. The reforms supported by the series reinforce its cross-cutting foundation of governance, including policies to reduce corruption, enhance transparency in public service and in the exploitation of natural resources, and strengthen the oversight role of civil society. Reforms to increase the resilience of the Ivorian economy include increasing the share of revenues from the main export crop, cocoa, received by farmers. Reforms to create jobs focus on improving the business climate, raising private investment, and supporting the growth of promising labor-intensive activities in rural areas, such as cashew production and cotton cultivation." }, "project_name" : "Cote d'Ivoire PRSC 1", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGD", "EntityID" : "000333037_20130806141405", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130806141405", "DocDate" : "25-JUL-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGID", "EntityID" : "000104615_20120521144052", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20120521144052", "DocDate" : "09-APR-2012" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Active", "regionname" : "Africa", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Central government administration" }, { "Name" : "Public administration- Industry and trade" }, { "Name" : "Crops" }, { "Name" : "General energy sector" }, { "Name" : "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Central government administration", "Percent" : 40 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "Public administration- Industry and trade", "Percent" : 20 }, "sector3" : { "Name" : "Crops", "Percent" : 15 }, "sector4" : { "Name" : "General energy sector", "Percent" : 15 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Central government administration", "code" : "BC" }, { "name" : "Public administration- Industry and trade", "code" : "BT" }, { "name" : "Crops", "code" : "AH" }, { "name" : "General energy sector", "code" : "LZ" }, { "name" : "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector", "code" : "AZ" } ], "sectorcode" : "AZ,LZ,AH,BT,BC", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Active", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Rural policies and institutions", "Percent" : 20 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Rural policies and institutions", "code" : "77" }, { "name" : "Other accountability/anti-corruption", "code" : "29" }, { "name" : "Export development and competitiveness", "code" : "45" }, { "name" : "Public expenditure, financial management and procurement", "code" : "27" } ], "themecode" : "27,45,29,77", "totalamt" : 50000000, "totalcommamt" : 50000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P127449/cote-divoire-prsg-1?lang=en" }

There are four components to the project: the first component being strengthening of marine management concept in marine protected areas. The second component is the strengthening coastal communities. This component is aimed at strengthening local communities' capacity to identify, develop and implement sub-projects aimed at: (i) reducing pressure on marine resources, and (ii) the provision of alternative livelihood income in such areas as fish processing, recreational fishing, eco-tourism and small, scale aquaculture. The third component is the regional environmental and socioeconomic monitoring network.

There are six components to the project, the first component being strengthening of state-level water institutions and inter-sector coordination. This component aims to provide support to the institutions in the state responsible for overall integrated water resources management and implementation of the state water policy. The second component is the modernization and rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage systems. The third component is the consolidation and enhancement of irrigation institutional reforms. This component will enhance the efficiency of the Uttar Pradesh Irrigation Department (UPID) and strengthen the Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) approach both in the department as well as in the community. The fourth component is the enhancing agriculture productivity and on-farm water management. This component (to be implemented directly by the Department of Agriculture) aims to improve the overall agriculture productivity and water-use efficiency at the field level. The fifth component is the feasibility studies and preparation activities for the next phase. This component is to prepare detailed surveys and designs for future third phase areas. These new areas will be identified by the Government of Uttar Pradesh and will make use of similar design principles (and the lessons learned) adopted under this second phase operation.

Most of the population is dispersed across rural areas of the archipelago, where they largely depend on subsistence agriculture. This caps food poverty rates, but exposes the population to environmental shocks. Poverty rates are higher in urban areas, where traditional safety nets are weaker and unemployment rates are high. A former British protectorate, the country became independent in 1978 and enjoyed twenty years of moderate but sustained economic growth and improvement in social indicators. A low-level conflict between 1998 and 2003, known as 'the tension,' brought the formal economy and many state functions to a halt. Real GDP per capita, which had been slowly eroding between 1996 and 1999, fell sharply between 2000 and 2002. An Australian-led and financed regional peacekeeping mission, the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), stopped the violence and rapidly restored order and basic state functions, particularly in finance. The country has subsequently enjoyed a fairly good security situation, interrupted only by short-lived but destructive riots in 2006, mainly in the capital Honiara. RAMSI presently retains a police and military presence, as well as a large corps of civilians in advisory or in line functions, notably in the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MoFT). Given the overall stability in the country, RAMSI will undergo a significant transition in mid-2013. Although an extensive police presence will remain to build the capacity of the Royal Solomon Islands police force, the bulk of the military component is scheduled to depart, and the advisory support will transition to bilateral programs." }, "project_name" : "Solomon Islands Development Policy Operation-2", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGD", "EntityID" : "000333037_20130808112918", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130808112918", "DocDate" : "25-JUL-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGID", "EntityID" : "000001843_20130422095101", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20130422095101", "DocDate" : "03-APR-2013" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Closed", "regionname" : "East Asia and Pacific", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Central government administration" }, { "Name" : "General industry and trade sector" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Central government administration", "Percent" : 90 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "General industry and trade sector", "Percent" : 10 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Central government administration", "code" : "BC" }, { "name" : "General industry and trade sector", "code" : "YZ" } ], "sectorcode" : "YZ,BC", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Closed", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Public expenditure, financial management and procurement", "Percent" : 90 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Public expenditure, financial management and procurement", "code" : "27" }, { "name" : "Participation and civic engagement", "code" : "57" } ], "themecode" : "57,27", "totalamt" : 2000000, "totalcommamt" : 2000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P143242?lang=en" }

This project focuses on the following geographical areas of production: the southwest around the Nawa region for cocoa, the southeastern regions of Sud Comoe and la Mé for rubber and oil palm, the central and northern regions of Hambol and Gontougo for cashew nuts, and the northern regions for cotton. Project activities are clustered around three technical components, combining value chains and geographic areas to facilitate implementation. The first component promotes a public-private partnership for sustainable cocoa development in southwest Côte dIvoire. The second component supports the expansion and renewal of village plantations of oil palm and rubber in southeast Côte dIvoire. The third component supports the cotton sector and promotion of cashew processing in central and northern Côte dIvoire. Each of the three components is similarly structured with three sub-components, namely improving access to markets, improving productivity in a sustainable way, and introducing institutional development to the value chain.

Thus the additional credit will: (a) protect financing for poverty-targeted programs; (b) support the government of Honduras in strengthening program operations and consolidating sector-level investments that are not necessarily benefitting the poor; and (c) deepen the World Banks engagement in the social protection sector." }, "project_name" : "Honduras Additional Financing Social Protection", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Indigenous Peoples Plan (IP),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "IP", "EntityID" : "000333037_20130716120516", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130716120516", "DocDate" : "10-JUL-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PJPR", "EntityID" : "000456286_20130723102411", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000456286_20130723102411", "DocDate" : "08-JUL-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISDS", "EntityID" : "090224b081c33d59_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c33d59_1_0", "DocDate" : "05-JUN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "090224b081c0f17a_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c0f17a_1_0", "DocDate" : "30-MAY-2013" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Active", "regionname" : "Latin America and Caribbean", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Other social services" }, { "Name" : "Public administration- Other social services" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Other social services", "Percent" : 78 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "Public administration- Other social services", "Percent" : 22 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Other social services", "code" : "JB" }, { "name" : "Public administration- Other social services", "code" : "BS" } ], "sectorcode" : "BS,JB", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Active", "supplementprojectflg" : "Y", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Social safety nets", "Percent" : 100 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Social safety nets", "code" : "54" } ], "themecode" : "54", "totalamt" : 12300000, "totalcommamt" : 12300000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P144928/honduras-additional-financing-social-protection?lang=en" }

At the Kabul and Lisbon Conferences in 2010, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Afghan government agreed that full responsibility for security would be handed over by 2014. The country now faces the prospect of a drawdown of most international military forces that so far have supported the fight against the ongoing insurgency. At the same time, Afghanistan is gearing up for a presidential election in April 2014 which many anticipate to be a difficult process given the complex political environment and challenging logistics. Despite these steps, Afghanistan will need to rely heavily on donor financing to ensure the continued provision of public services and investment through the transition period. At the request of the authorities, this Development Policy Grant (DPG) series is designed to support the government's strategy for developing greater economic and fiscal self-reliance. The reform program is ambitious, especially in light of the upcoming elections, but it is strongly supported by the government, key stakeholders and donors. This program document describes the first in a series of two programmatic grants to Afghanistan. The first operation is in the amount of US$50 million, out of US$100 million for the programmatic series. A programmatic approach is proposed to carry on reform momentum and strengthen reform incentives during times in which political incentives for reforms are typically low due to upcoming election. Moreover, lessons from other operations in Afghanistan favor a carefully sequenced and continuous reform-approach." }, "project_name" : "AF: Development Policy Prog.

This component will support a PBF pilot at the PHC level in eight rayons (or districts) in Khatlon and Sogd oblasts (regions). Under the PBF pilot, Rural Health Centers (RHCs) and their subsidiary Health Houses (HHs) will be eligible to receive a performance-based payment each quarter based on the quality and quantity of Maternal and Child Health (MCH) and Non-communicable Diseases (NCD) services delivered. The development and testing of the PBF scheme is currently being financed by a separate preparation grant from the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF). The second component is primary health care strengthening. This component will aim to improve the capacity of PHC providers to deliver quality services.

The Project consists of the following five components: (i) construction of two metro stations of the Quito Metro Line One; (ii) infrastructure and equipment investment for the Quito Metro Line One; (iii) provision of train sets to operate in the Quito Metro Line One; (iv) Project Management; and (V) technical studies to support implementation." }, "project_name" : "Quito Metro Line One", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Board Summary (SU),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "SU", "EntityID" : "000445729_20130806123931", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000445729_20130806123931", "DocDate" : "25-JUL-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PAD", "EntityID" : "000445729_20130709113927", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000445729_20130709113927", "DocDate" : "28-JUN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PAD", "EntityID" : "000333037_20131009163948", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20131009163948", "DocDate" : "28-JUN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "090224b081c9e752_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c9e752_1_0", "DocDate" : "23-JUN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISDS", "EntityID" : "090224b081c757e9_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c757e9_1_0", "DocDate" : "17-JUN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISDS", "EntityID" : "090224b081bb1aa4_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081bb1aa4_1_0", "DocDate" : "14-MAY-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "090224b081b80ce3_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081b80ce3_1_0", "DocDate" : "05-MAY-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.4 of 4", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000356161_20130607120101", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20130607120101", "DocDate" : "01-MAY-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "RPL", "EntityID" : "000231615_20130618113357", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000231615_20130618113357", "DocDate" : "01-MAY-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2 of 4", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000356161_20130328121227", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20130328121227", "DocDate" : "26-MAR-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2 of 4", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000333037_20130327120934", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130327120934", "DocDate" : "01-NOV-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.3 of 4", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000020439_20130405130513", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20130405130513", "DocDate" : "01-NOV-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1 of 4", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000425962_20130117165638", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000425962_20130117165638", "DocDate" : "01-JAN-2012" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IBRD", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Active", "regionname" : "Latin America and Caribbean", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Public administration- Transportation" }, { "Name" : "Urban Transport" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Public administration- Transportation", "Percent" : 5 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "Urban Transport", "Percent" : 95 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Public administration- Transportation", "code" : "BV" }, { "name" : "Urban Transport", "code" : "TC" } ], "sectorcode" : "TC,BV", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Active", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Climate change", "Percent" : 5 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Climate change", "code" : "81" } ], "themecode" : "81", "totalamt" : 205000000, "totalcommamt" : 205000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P144489/ecuador-quito-metro-line-one?lang=en" }

This Disbursement-linked indicator (DLI) aimed to gradually increase the use of payment service providers (PSPs) that: (i) make payments electronically, and (ii) use two-factor authentication. The large distances covered by the program combined with severe capacity constraints within the government administration in Northern Kenya has meant that all key areas of the Hunger Safety Net Program (HSNP) implementation are subcontracted as follows: a) the administrative component, including targeting, enrollment, registration, and case management, is implemented by a consortium of Non-Governmental Organization (NGOs) headed by Oxfam GB; b) the payments component is managed by the Financial Sector Deepening Trust, which in turn sub-contracted Equity Bank to deliver payments to beneficiaries through a network of banking agents; c) the social protection rights component, which is designed to spread awareness of beneficiaries' rights, entitlements and responsibilities and to manage the complaint and grievance mechanism, is implemented by help age international; and d) the monitoring and evaluation component has been implemented by oxford policy management, which collects and analyzes data on a range of process and impact indicators." }, "project_name" : "National Safety Net Program for Results", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PAD", "EntityID" : "000333037_20130704110647", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130704110647", "DocDate" : "26-JUN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000333037_20130613112339", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130613112339", "DocDate" : "11-JUN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Other Social Protection Study (SPS),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "SPS", "EntityID" : "000442464_20130910122015", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130910122015", "DocDate" : "01-JAN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Other Social Protection Study (SPS),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "SPS", "EntityID" : "000442464_20130910123612", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130910123612", "DocDate" : "01-JAN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGID", "EntityID" : "000020953_20120815093932", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20120815093932", "DocDate" : "15-JUN-2012" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Active", "regionname" : "Africa", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Public administration- Other social services" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Public administration- Other social services", "Percent" : 100 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Public administration- Other social services", "code" : "BS" } ], "sectorcode" : "BS", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Active", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Social safety nets", "Percent" : 90 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Social safety nets", "code" : "54" }, { "name" : "Natural disaster management", "code" : "52" }, { "name" : "Social risk mitigation", "code" : "87" } ], "themecode" : "87,52,54", "totalamt" : 250000000, "totalcommamt" : 250000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P131305/national-integrated-safety-net-program?lang=en" }

The project has three components. The first component is maintaining access to essential healthcare services. This component aims to sustain the provision of essential healthcare services to the Jordanian population which is at risk due to the stress on resources resulting from the large influx of Syrian refugees. It has following two sub-components: (i) provision of vaccines and essential drugs to ensure adequate and continuous supply at all public healthcare facilities; and (ii) financing of healthcare services for Jordanians in non- Ministry of Health (MOH) health facilities. The second component is supporting household basic needs. The objective of this component is to help the Government of Jordan (GOJ) ensure the uninterrupted supply of basic household commodities for poor and lower middle class households. The two subsidized products financed under this component are bread (wheat) and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders. The third component is project monitoring, auditing, and verification.

The second pillar consists of public finance management reforms that support improved management and transparency around the use of public funds at a time of increased expenditure necessitated by the disaster response and heightened fiscal pressures.

The project has three components. The first component is strengthening the institutional, legal, regulatory, tax and governance framework for microfinance. This component aims to: (a) prepare an action plan to assess and reinforce the capacity of the National Federation of Microcredit Associations of Morocco (FNAM); and (b) support activities contributing to the strengthening of the legal, regulatory, tax and governance framework of the microfinance sector. This component will also finance goods, services, travel, and incremental operating costs incurred by the Project Management Unit (PMU) in the implementation and management of the project. It has following two sub-components: (a) prepare an action plan, including a comprehensive assessment to reinforce the capacity of the FNAM; and (b) carrying out studies to inform the development of a modern legal, regulatory, tax and governance framework for microfinance. The second component is strengthening the market infrastructure, product innovation and funding sources for microfinance. This component focuses on activities aimed at: (a) building common platforms improving the efficiency and effectiveness of microcredit associations; (b) building market infrastructure in support of microenterprises; and (c) promoting the strengthening and diversification of funding. It has following three sub-components: (i) promoting innovative common platforms and new products for Microfinance Institutions (MFIs); (ii) building market infrastructure for micro entrepreneurs; and (iii) strengthening and diversifying funding sources. The third component is integrating microfinance into a national financial inclusion strategy.

This component includes a 3x650-MW supercritical steam technology power plant, fired by natural gas as the primary fuel and by Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) as a backup. The plant comprises three identical units, each of 650 MW gross capacities. The plant will be cooled by a once-through cooling system using water from the Nile River. Each of the three units will include the standard set of equipment: a 650-MW steam generator, a steam turbine, a condenser, and an electricity generator; process and cooling water supply systems; an air and flue gas system; a fuel supply system; and a number of auxiliary systems (condensate treatment, hydrogen generation, compressed air, fire protection, emergency diesel generator, start-up power system, medium and low voltage system, direct current power system for control and relays, and uninterruptible power system). Finally, the second component is the gas pipelines. This component includes two gas pipelines capable of supplying approximately 12.5 million cubic meters of gas per day. One pipeline, 36 inches in diameter and 93 kilometers (km) long, will connect the Helwan South power plant site, which is near the town of Atfeeh, to the existing gas pipeline network at the compressor station at Dahshour." }, "project_name" : "EG - Helwan South Power Project", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" :

The sub-components will dovetail the almost complete support provided by the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) to renovate, refurbish and equip health centers, including reinstating adequate provisions for waiting shelters for expecting mothers. Building on infrastructure improvement supported by MCA, the project will contribute to the supply-side improvements which are fundamental to strengthen the quality and utilization of health services. (2) Training of health professionals and Village Health Workers (VHWs) and improving monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity component will be solely financed through IDA financing and have two subcomponents. (2A) Training health professionals and VHWs will support an ongoing MOH program for training doctors, nurse anesthetists and midwives to achieve an acceptable standard of competency in the delivery of MNH.

This project paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an additional loan in an amount of US$20.00 million to the project. The additional loan will help finance the costs associated with scaling up activities of a well-performing project in order to enhance the impact. This project paper also seeks the approval of a restructuring consisting in minor changes to the Project Development Objective (PDO) and related changes to the results framework. There are no new safeguard or fiduciary issues applicable to the additional financing (AF), which will use the same environmental and social management framework as the original project, updated in 2011. In terms of outcomes, the AF will support the preparation and implementation of more than 1,000 additional plans benefiting 31,600 additional families, compared to about 1,500 plans and 53,600 families under the original project, bringing the cumulative totals to about 2,500 plans and more than 85,000 beneficiary families.

The project aims to construct 2000 classrooms to alleviate the rising student-to-classroom ratio in the medium and long term, as enrollments continue to rise. The projects also aims to increase access and improve the quality of education through the school grants program in selected areas, which together with the provision of textbooks, will reduce the cost of schooling for households and improve the learning environment.

The project has three components. Component 1 is Performance-based Financing (PBF) scheme to improve MCH and NCD services in primary care facilities (US$4.3 million, of which US$1.8 million from the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF) Grant). This component will support the strengthening of the on-going primary health care Performance-based Financing (PBF) program in Armenia as well as expanding its scope. It comprises two sub-components as follows: (1) performance-based payments for MCH and NCD (US$ 3.5million); and (2) performance-based financing implementation and capacity building (US$ 0.8 million). The second component is improving efficiency and quality of selected hospitals (US$38.9 million). This component aims at improving further efficiency and quality of hospital services provision in Armenia by supporting hospital optimization in the only remaining region and improving infrastructure and treatment capacity at selected specialized tertiary level mono-profile hospitals. It comprises four subcomponents as follows: (1) modernization of Lori Marz hospital network (US$13.0 million); (2) modernization of Center of Hematology named after Professor Yeolyan CJSC (US$13.0 million); (3) modernization of cancer treatment services in Armenia (US$12.4 million); and (4) hospital quality improvement (US$0.5million).

The operation supports four areas that are central to the Government's reform program: (1) tax reform will support the Government's tax policy and administration reforms and its improvements in international tax information sharing. Together, these reforms are expected to mobilize tax revenue and facilitate the international exchange of tax information; (2) modernizing public procurement practices will significantly increase accountability and transparency and reduce transaction costs, since 37 percent of non-financial sector public spending is done through procurement; (3) increasing the efficiency of debt management; a major challenge for debt management in Panama is the lack of a medium-term debt management strategy. In particular, while overall guidelines such as the development of the domestic debt market and the smoothing of the debt profile exist, there is no formal debt management strategy in place. Such a strategy will establish target ranges for selected indicators of financial risk after assessing the cost-risk tradeoffs of different alternatives; and (4) and expanding and improving targeting of social transfer programs." }, "project_name" : "Second Programmatic Development Policy Loan", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISRR", "EntityID" : "090224b081cf60ca_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081cf60ca_1_0", "DocDate" : "08-JUL-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGD", "EntityID" : "000350881_20130305095443", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20130305095443", "DocDate" : "15-FEB-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGD", "EntityID" : "000442464_20130625111342", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130625111342", "DocDate" : "15-FEB-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000001843_20130214092900", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20130214092900", "DocDate" : "11-JAN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000425962_20130305134429", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000425962_20130305134429", "DocDate" : "11-JAN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000001843_20130205123330", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20130205123330", "DocDate" : "05-NOV-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000104615_20121203163632", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20121203163632", "DocDate" : "05-NOV-2012" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IBRD", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Closed", "regionname" : "Latin America and Caribbean", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Central government administration" }, { "Name" : "General public administration sector" }, { "Name" : "Other social services" }, { "Name" : "Primary education" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Central government administration", "Percent" : 50 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "General public administration sector", "Percent" : 17 }, "sector3" : { "Name" : "Other social services", "Percent" : 17 }, "sector4" : { "Name" : "Primary education", "Percent" : 16 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Central government administration", "code" : "BC" }, { "name" : "General public administration sector", "code" : "BZ" }, { "name" : "Other social services", "code" : "JB" }, { "name" : "Primary education", "code" : "EP" } ], "sectorcode" : "EP,JB,BZ,BC", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Closed", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Debt management and fiscal sustainability", "Percent" : 17 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Debt management and fiscal sustainability", "code" : "21" }, { "name" : "Social safety nets", "code" : "54" }, { "name" : "Public expenditure, financial management and procurement", "code" : "27" }, { "name" : "Social risk mitigation", "code" : "87" }, { "name" : "Tax policy and administration", "code" : "28" } ], "themecode" : "28,87,27,54,21", "totalamt" : 100000000, "totalcommamt" : 100000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P127332/second-programmatic-development-policy-loan?lang=en" }

This component has following two sub-components: (1) help the Borrower to develop systems to coordinate and manage safety nets programs for the poor and vulnerable; and (2) finance the cost of the management, coordination, and monitoring and evaluation (M and E) activities under this and the other two project components. The second component is the pilot cash transfer program with accompanying measures to boost household productivity (US$36.3 million). This component is for supporting the development and to boost the productivity of chronically poor households and serve as the cornerstone of Cameroons social safety net. Accompanying measures are to be developed to maximize the impact of the cash transfers on the welfare and productivity of beneficiary households.

Overall long-term growth projections remain positive but dependent on commodity shocks and on public investment efficiency, while inclusive growth will depend on the economy's ability for structural transformation.

The project has following two components: (1) sunshine schools program support - installation of 100 megawatt (MW) rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in Beijing. This component will install 100 MW of distributed rooftop PV systems in about 800 schools and other educational institutions in Beijing under the Renewable Energy Service Company (RESCO) model for large-scale rooftop solar PV deployment. Similar to the Energy Service Company (ESCO) business model adopted by the central government as a key market mechanism to scale up energy efficiency investments, the RESCO will take the performance and financial risk of the investment by signing an energy service performance contract (ESPC) with each school and university, which will pay the RESCO only for the solar PV electricity it consumes. The Bank loan will be on-lent to the RESCO by the Beijing municipality; and (2) technical assistance (TA) for developing local capacity for scaling up solar energy deployment, project implementation, and other priority energy policy initiatives of the Beijing Municipal Government (BMG). TA activities include: (i) demonstration of the RESCO model for large-scale grid-connected rooftop solar PV deployment in Beijing municipality, provision of engineering and technical support in relation to PV systems to Yuanshen Company, and independent monitoring and evaluation of implementation and results of such model; (ii) demonstration of two-way metering in Beijing municipality; (iii) establishment of an online monitoring system for rooftop PV systems and a solar energy information portal in Beijing municipality; and (iv) improvement of renewable energy education in schools and other educational institutions in Beijing municipality." }, "project_name" : "CN: Beijing Rooftop Solar Photovoltaic Scale-Up (Sunshine Schools) Project", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Disbursement Letter (Disbursement Letter),  Vol.", "DocType" : "Disbursement Letter", "EntityID" : "090224b082036295_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082036295_1_0", "DocDate" : "10-JUL-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.", "DocType" : "PRA", "EntityID" : "090224b082036253_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082036253_1_0", "DocDate" : "10-JUL-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.", "DocType" : "LA", "EntityID" : "090224b082036200_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082036200_1_0", "DocDate" : "10-JUL-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISRR", "EntityID" : "090224b081c912cf_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c912cf_1_0", "DocDate" : "20-JUN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PAD", "EntityID" : "000442464_20130304105822", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130304105822", "DocDate" : "07-FEB-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "090224b0818582da_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0818582da_1_0", "DocDate" : "26-DEC-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISDS", "EntityID" : "090224b0818430f6_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0818430f6_1_0", "DocDate" : "26-DEC-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "090224b0817df23b_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0817df23b_1_0", "DocDate" : "05-DEC-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISDS", "EntityID" : "090224b0817eee9c_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0817eee9c_1_0", "DocDate" : "05-DEC-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000333038_20121029014326", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20121029014326", "DocDate" : "01-AUG-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000333038_20121029013954", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20121029013954", "DocDate" : "01-AUG-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISDS", "EntityID" : "0000A8056_2011122915320679", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011122915320679", "DocDate" : "29-DEC-2011" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "0000A8056_2011122914303915", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011122914303915", "DocDate" : "29-DEC-2011" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IBRD", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Active", "regionname" : "East Asia and Pacific", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Other Renewable Energy" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Other Renewable Energy", "Percent" : 100 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Other Renewable Energy", "code" : "LR" } ], "sectorcode" : "LR", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Active", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Other urban development", "Percent" : 33 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Other urban development", "code" : "74" }, { "name" : "Climate change", "code" : "81" } ], "themecode" : "81,74", "totalamt" : 120000000, "totalcommamt" : 120000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P125022/cn-beijing-energy-efficiency-emission-reduction-demo?lang=en" }

The operation will also look at two cross-cutting themes: (a) protecting the poor from adverse effects of Vietnam's economic transition and competitiveness-related reforms; and (b) promoting greater data and policymaking transparency. Analytical work and policy dialogue will aim to ensure that these cross-cutting issues are appropriately taken into account in the reforms supported under the operation. The design of the EMCC is based on feedback from the government and development partners, and lessons learnt from implementation of the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) series." }, "project_name" : "Economic Management Competitiveness Credit 1", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISRR", "EntityID" : "090224b081dd98e6_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dd98e6_1_0", "DocDate" : "11-AUG-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.", "DocType" : "FIA", "EntityID" : "090224b081c9062c_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c9062c_1_0", "DocDate" : "14-MAY-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "Summary of Discussion", "EntityID" : "000333037_20130325095848", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130325095848", "DocDate" : "19-MAR-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGD", "EntityID" : "000333037_20130402100947", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130402100947", "DocDate" : "19-FEB-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000001843_20121227102846", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20121227102846", "DocDate" : "21-DEC-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000104615_20121114132954", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20121114132954", "DocDate" : "25-OCT-2012" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Closed", "regionname" : "East Asia and Pacific", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "General public administration sector" }, { "Name" : "Banking" }, { "Name" : "General industry and trade sector" }, { "Name" : "Central government administration" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "General public administration sector", "Percent" : 34 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "Banking", "Percent" : 22 }, "sector3" : { "Name" : "General industry and trade sector", "Percent" : 22 }, "sector4" : { "Name" : "Central government administration", "Percent" : 22 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "General public administration sector", "code" : "BZ" }, { "name" : "Banking", "code" : "FA" }, { "name" : "General industry and trade sector", "code" : "YZ" }, { "name" : "Central government administration", "code" : "BC" } ], "sectorcode" : "BC,YZ,FA,BZ", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Closed", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization", "Percent" : 22 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization", "code" : "43" }, { "name" : "Public expenditure, financial management and procurement", "code" : "27" }, { "name" : "Other accountability/anti-corruption", "code" : "29" }, { "name" : "Regulation and competition policy", "code" : "40" }, { "name" : "Macroeconomic management", "code" : "23" } ], "themecode" : "23,40,29,27,43", "totalamt" : 250000000, "totalcommamt" : 250000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P122793/economic-management-competitiveness-credit-1?lang=en" }

The credit will help finance the costs associated with alleviating the emergency in the country's agriculture sector caused by the 2012 drought. The drought caused extensive losses to the country's field crops, i.e. wheat, sunflower, and particularly corn (for example 60 percent losses in corn production), leading to a shortage of animal feed. Without immediate support to affected farmers the livestock sub-sector will be under significant risk for destocking and loss of capital, with potential long-term negative consequences. The project will help to reduce the risk of destocking by providing conditional cash transfers and technical assistance (awareness and training) to farmers in the most affected districts, so as to maintain their ability to plant spring crops, and particularly corn and wheat. Corn is an especially important crop because pastures are scarce in Moldova, and corn is the main animal feed, both in the form of grain and silage. Corn is also an important staple for Moldovans, as it used in the local diet for the traditional dish called mamaliga." }, "project_name" : "Emergency Agriculture Support Project", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISRR", "EntityID" : "090224b081f19ed5_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081f19ed5_1_0", "DocDate" : "25-SEP-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.", "DocType" : "FIA", "EntityID" : "090224b081c3c554_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c3c554_1_0", "DocDate" : "29-MAY-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Disbursement Letter (Disbursement Letter),  Vol.", "DocType" : "Disbursement Letter", "EntityID" : "090224b081c3c5be_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c3c5be_1_0", "DocDate" : "29-MAY-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PJPR", "EntityID" : "000442464_20130319170123", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130319170123", "DocDate" : "01-MAR-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "ISDS", "EntityID" : "000001843_20130212112157", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20130212112157", "DocDate" : "12-FEB-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000001843_20130212111009", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20130212111009", "DocDate" : "14-DEC-2012" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Active", "regionname" : "Europe and Central Asia", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Crops" }, { "Name" : "Other social services" }, { "Name" : "Public administration- Agriculture, fishing and forestry" }, { "Name" : "Animal production" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Crops", "Percent" : 46 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "Other social services", "Percent" : 46 }, "sector3" : { "Name" : "Public administration- Agriculture, fishing and forestry", "Percent" : 7 }, "sector4" : { "Name" : "Animal production", "Percent" : 1 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Crops", "code" : "AH" }, { "name" : "Other social services", "code" : "JB" }, { "name" : "Public administration- Agriculture, fishing and forestry", "code" : "BL" }, { "name" : "Animal production", "code" : "AJ" } ], "sectorcode" : "AJ,BL,JB,AH", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Active", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Social safety nets", "Percent" : 48 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Social safety nets", "code" : "54" }, { "name" : "Other rural development", "code" : "79" } ], "themecode" : "79,54", "totalamt" : 10000000, "totalcommamt" : 10000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P143202/emergency-agriculture-support-project?lang=en" }

Looking forward, the challenge will be in the implementation and coordination of all the policies that affect private sector development, investment and job creation.

On-budget funding will support the implementation of key elements of the Government's ECE program (program 239, complemented by decision 60). The SRPP will reimburse Government investments under the following eligible expenditure programs: (a) lunch subsidies3 for disadvantaged children aged 3-54, which will encourage participation and full day preschool attendance; and (b) salaries, including social and health insurance contributions, for contract preschool teachers to ease the shortage of teaching staff. Finally, the second component is the national early childhood education policy development and capacity building.

The Additional Financing (AF) will support connecting an additional 48,000 households to the electricity grid as part of the second phase of the Electricity Access Rollout Program (EARP). In addition, the AF will support scaling up of 'green connections' associated with energy efficient solutions; increased uptake of solar products such as solar water heaters and solar photo-voltaic systems; low-cost products such as ready-boards to make it affordable for low-income households to get connected to the electricity grid; and productive uses of electricity to promote increased use of electricity by SMEs. The additional activities have been estimated to be implemented in a timeframe of about 3 1/2 years.

The works will include works to the road surface and pavement, drainage improvements, restoration of shoulders and road furniture such as guardrails, road signs and marking. The second component is the institutional support and capacity building. This component will finance activities to strengthen the RMF's and Ministry of Public Works and Highways, or MPWH's capacity for road asset management, including axle load controls through technological connectivity of the control stations with RMF's headquarters in Sana'a and installation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) equipment and software for improved communication with the road users. Finally, the third component is the transport sector studies. This component will finance technical assistance to address deficiencies and inefficiencies in transport infrastructure provision, maintenance and operation, at the same time support preparation of investments with potentials for other donors' financial support. This will include feasibility and preliminary engineering and operations and maintenance studies to assess the potential of public, private and/or public private partnership investments in the transport sector in Yemen, including public transport and operation of Sana'a and Aden airports and of Al-Hodeidah seaport." }, "project_name" : "RY-Road Asset Management Project", "projectdocs" : [ {

There are four components to the project, the first component being institutional strengthening, and capacity building and implementation support of Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM). This component aims to develop and/or strengthen DHM's legal and regulatory frameworks, improve institutional performance as the main provider of weather, climate and hydrological information for the nation, build capacity of personnel and management, ensure operability of the future networks, and support project implementation. The second component is the modernization of the observation networks and forecasting. The third component is the enhancement of the service delivery system of DHM. The objective of this component is to enhance the service delivery system of DHM by creating a public weather service that provides weather and impact forecasts, and information services for climate-vulnerable communities and the key weather dependent sectors of economy.

This new series builds on the excellent sectoral dialogue with the Government, the overall success of the previous two operations and the need to consolidate medium-term reforms. It will be implemented in parallel with the second phase (2013-2017) of the Government's ongoing 15-year National Solid Waste Program (PNDM) and will support its transition to full implementation and roll-out, while focusing on the overall coherence of the sector with the new decentralization agenda. In this context, the programmatic series aims to support the Government's efforts to improve the economic, environmental and social performance of the MSW sector. The measures supported by this DPL focus on: 1) strengthening governance, particularly demand-side governance, in the sector by improving accountability, transparency, and access to information, and by providing citizens and civil society with new and effective opportunities for engagement and voice; 2) anchoring long-term institutional and financial sustainability of the sector in line with the new decentralization agenda; 3) upgrading the country's environmental monitoring and control system; and 4) developing a financially viable and socially inclusive waste recycling sector.

This component will implement measures to strengthen the climate resilience of the economically critical WCR, which is a key Government of Samoa (GoS) objective under the Strategic Program for Climate Resilience (SPCR). Works will improve the road pavement between Vailoa junction in Apia and Faleolo International Airport (approximately 26 km) by raising and strengthening vulnerable sections of the WCR, sealing shoulders, and improving longitudinal and cross drainage. The second component is the vulnerability assessment of the Samoa road network. This component involves technical assistance that will directly support the SPCR by bringing about transformative change in the way that climate change is addressed in the Samoa roads sector. Finally, the third component is the project management and operating costs. This component will also provide funding for specific inter-project SPCR coordination activities, such as: (a) knowledge exchange and lessons learned to feed into the coordination of the SPCR at a programmatic level; (b) resources for GoS officials to participate and contribute to overall SPCR processes; and (c) monitoring and evaluating project results." }, "project_name" : "Enhancing the

The project has two components. (1) Lifeline road improvement component will finance the improvement (rehabilitation and/or upgrading) of an estimated 170 km of lifeline roads. The first year program was identified during the project preparation. Around 72 km (seven road segments) will be improved (including a 23 km corridor where a pilot on rehabilitation and maintenance is going to be implemented). The remaining 98 km will be identified during the implementation. Detailed designs for those roads, as well as supervision of civil works are also included under this component.

This DPL for US$260 million is to be implemented as a single operation with a Deferred Drawdown Option (DDO). Uruguay recorded a strong macro economic performance over the past nine years. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged more than 5 percent per year in the period the 2002 debt crisis. The year 2011 was the ninth consecutive year of GDP growth, marking one of the longest growth periods in the country's history. Prudent macroeconomic policies, improvements in structural areas and favorable external economic conditions, such as buoyant demand for its main export products and a booming regional economy, have contributed to the strong economic performance of Uruguay and helped protect the economy during the 2008/2009 crisis. Private consumption continues to be the main driver of the economy. As in previous years, with the exception of 2009, when GDP growth was driven by the external sector, private consumption was the main driver of economic growth. Private consumption grew by 7.6 percent in real terms in 2011, accounting for 6.1 percentage points of total growth. Gross domestic investment, fueled by still high levels of foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows (4.7 percent of GDP in 2011), grew by 7 percent and explained 1.4 percentage points of GDP growth.

There are three components to the project, the first component being support to Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) to upgrade the urban road transport infrastructure. This component will involve: constructing and rehabilitating non-motorized transport facilities, including foot paths, cycle tracks, pedestrian bridges and underpasses; and carrying out feasibility and detailed engineering design studies of roads adjoining major towns and studies for improvement of traffic flows through provision of technical advisory services. The second component is the support to Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA) and Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) to develop selected mass transit corridors. The activities under this component of the project, which include carrying out feasibility studies and detailed engineering designs and preparation of bidding and contract documents for works and associated facilities as well as selection of private sector operators to provide large capacity buses for a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system and rolling stock for a commuter rail system are a precursor for a successor project. Finally, the third component is the institutional strengthening and capacity building. This component will support and deepen the implementation of reforms in the transport sector with a major focus on urban transport." }, "project_name" : "KENYA: NATIONAL URBAN TRANSPORT IMPROVEMENT
